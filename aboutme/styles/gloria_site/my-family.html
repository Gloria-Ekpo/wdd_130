                My mother go by the name Rosemary Johnson. She is an amazing role model and I appeciate everything she does for me and our family. Without any doubt, she is the most important person in my life. 
                She not only worked hard to ensure that I had a good upbringing, but was also strict and often punished me whenever I went wrong. Even though I did not like the punishment then, I now look back and realize that it was meant to lovingly correct
                and help me to follow the right path when growing up.
