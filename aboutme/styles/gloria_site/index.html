                My name is Gloria Ekpo. I am an undergraduate at Brigham Young University Idaho with a keen interest in software development. I’m especially interested in learning how to create applications that meet the end user’s goals, communicating effectively with team members to delegate work, finding and fixing bugs in codes, and meeting tight deadlines for clients. 
                Think about the last time you used an application. Did everything go smoothly? That’s what I’ll be doing; I’ll be creating applications and I also want to spend the rest of my career doing research and learning new technologies to offer unique creative solutions.</p>
